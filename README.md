An advanced extension of the standard FFmpeg `v360` filter, introducing **Rig Mode** for seamless stitching of multi-camera setups. This project provides a robust solution for transforming multiple directional video inputs into a cohesive 360° panoramic output with high-quality blending.

## Mathematical Model

To ensure seamless stitching between camera views, we implement a **Weighted Inverse Projection** algorithm using **Hermite interpolation** with **Cubic Priority** for optimal ghosting reduction.

The blending weight is calculated in two steps:

1.  **Base Smoothness**: A base weight $W_{base}(t)$ is derived from the normalized distance $t$ to the edge of the field of view using Hermite interpolation:

    $$W_{base}(t) = t^2 \cdot (3 - 2t)$$

    Where $t \in [0, 1]$. This ensures $C^1$ continuity at the boundaries.

2.  **Center Priority**: To prioritize the highest quality pixels from the center of the lens and suppress edge artifacts, the final weight $W$ is cubed:

    $$W = (W_{base}(t))^3$$

This non-linear priority weighting significantly improves the visual coherence of the stitched panorama.

## Features

-   **Rig Mode (`input=tiles`)**: Accept an arbitrary number of inputs laid out in a grid (tiled) format.
-   **Priority Blending**: Smart blending that prioritizes "stronger" central pixels over edge pixels to reduce ghosting.
-   **High Fidelity**: Uses high-order interpolation methods for geometry remapping.
-   **Configurable**: Full control over Field of View (FOV), Yaw, Pitch, Roll, and Blend Width.

## Integration / Build Steps

This repository is designed as an extension patch for FFmpeg.

### Prerequisites
-   Linux environment or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
-   Dependencies: `build-essential`, `yasm`, `nasm`, `pkg-config`, `libx264-dev` (and other FFmpeg deps)

### 1. Build using the helper script (Recommended)
We provide a script to automate the cloning, patching, and building process.

```bash
./scripts/build_ffmpeg.sh
```

### 2. Manual Integration
If you prefer to integrate manually into your own FFmpeg source tree:

```bash
# 1. Clone FFmpeg
git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd FFmpeg
git checkout n8.0.1  # Recommended version

# 2. Apply the patch
# Assuming you are in the root of the FFmpeg repo and have this repo at ../ffmpeg-v360-advanced
git am ../ffmpeg-v360-advanced/patches/0001-Add-Rig-Mode-implementation.patch

# OR copy files manually
# cp ../ffmpeg-v360-advanced/src/vf_v360.c libavfilter/
# cp ../ffmpeg-v360-advanced/src/v360.h libavfilter/

# 3. Configure and Build
./configure --enable-filter=v360 --enable-gpl --enable-libx264
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Usage Example

The `tiles` input mode is designed to stitch multiple synchronized input streams. You must use `-filter_complex` to map all input streams into the `v360` filter and specify the camera angles for each input.

Assuming you have 4 inputs (Front, Right, Back, Left) with 90° FOV:

```bash
ffmpeg \
    -i front.mp4 -i right.mp4 -i back.mp4 -i left.mp4 \
    -filter_complex \
    "[0:v][1:v][2:v][3:v]v360=input=tiles:output=equirect:h_fov=360:v_fov=180: \
    rig_fov=90:cam_angles='0 0 0 90 0 180 0 270': \
    blend_width=0.1[outv]" \
    -map "[outv]" output_panorama.mp4
```

* **`input=tiles`**: Activates the multi-input Rig Mode.
* **`rig_fov`**: Specifies the Field of View for individual input cameras.
* **`cam_angles`**: A list of Pitch/Yaw pairs for each input (order matches the input stream order).
* **`blend_width`**: Controls the edge blending area.
